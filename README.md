# cryptos_explained

<p>Cryptos Explained is an easy to use easy to navigate Website with the goal of explaining the many different types of CryptoCurrencies.</p>
<p>The site is not finished but the fundamental building blocks are there, but I will continue to expand and work on them to encompass the ever shifting CryptoCurrency field</p>

<h1>Site Overview</h1>
<p>The homepage shows the stock images of most of the high market cap crypto currencies, hovering your mouse each picture displays the name of the currency along with the option to click on it</p>
<p>As of now not each currency has a dedicated page, but the ones that due follow the same pattern, its current market standings, and the whitepaper, while this should be expanded (see to do) the best explanation for a currency is the whitepaper associated with it</p>
<p>Addiotinally I have included a Vocabulary tab where the most commonly used words in the Crypto-sphere can be defined in Layman terms</p>
<h1>Functionality</h1>
<p>Most of the code has comments on it to explain it use, the CSS file handle the layout of the page and the size of the images which has been restricted for layout sake</p>
<p>The search bar searches the Images alt based on User input, the Overlay name is not the one that is searched allowing it to be edited to fit the box </p>
<h1>To-DO</h1>
<ol>
  <li>Add terms to the vocabulary</li>
  <li>Add Javascripts infinite scroll to keep content on one page, allowing search results to span the whole content</li>
  <li>Add more content that I have collected, techinical documents, artwork etc</li>
  <li>Defintions to cryptocurrencies</li>
  <li>Sort Currencies by current rank on CMC</li>
 </ol>
